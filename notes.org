*** Installing a Custom ROM + Rooting

Installing a Custom ROM + Rooting in 4.1 steps:

- The device needs to be *OEM Unlocked* from the developer settings:
  - If the device is locked by *Factory Reset Protection* you need to bypass
    it. Bypassing *FRP* is specific to each device/android versions. This is the
    hardest part.
- Flash a new *Recovery Image* with fastboot (or with Odin/Heimdall for Samsung
  devices). [[https://twrp.me/][TWRP]] is the de facto choice of *Recovery Image*. The image is
  specific to each device.
- From the *Recovery Image* flash [[https://lineageos.org/][LineageOS]] with the sideload feature. The image
  is specific to each device.
- In the same manner flash the de facto choice of root solution [[https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk][Magisk]].

** Assembly
*** ABI
ABIs (Application Binary Interface) are specifications on:

- Registers, memory, ...
- Calling conventions, which specify how functions should call each others,
  more precisely the way arguments should be passed, how the stack should
  be handled, and how the registers should be saved.
- How user functions should make System Calls.

It can change from architectures (ARM, x86, MIPS...) to operating systems
(Linux/BSD vs Windows) and languages (C, Java, Python...). It is usually the
job of the compilers to respect them (eg. between user space programs and the
kernel, but not necessarily in the same program).

cs: abi: {{c1::x32}} is an ABI that {{c2::is the same as the x86-64 ABI but uses 32-bit
pointers::... BUT ...}}

*** Frame Pointer

The frame pointer is a pointer to the base of the previous function stack.
It is used to restore the stack pointer when returning from a function call.

In the following example, you can see that the previous stack base pointer (rbp)
is saved on the stack. This variable on the stack can now be called a frame
pointer. It is later poped off the stack before returning from the function.

*** NOP

=NOP= is an instruction that does nothing by design. Historically (before
x86-64) it was equivalent to =XCHG EAX,EAX=. Now it just does nothing.
(https://stackoverflow.com/a/25053039)

It is typically used to align the start of functions because jumps are
apparently faster if the instruction is aligned on a 4/8/16 bytes boundary.

*** x86
**** Stack Limits

Although "allocating" space on the stack doesn't require a syscall, its size is
still limited by the Kernel.

When a user space program tries to access memory that isn't yet allocated to it,
a page fault occurs and the kernel can then check if the memory size exceeds the
stack limit. (https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/239323)

*** Keyboard Shortcuts

Firefox and Chrome share a healthy number of shortcut keys (Replace with Cmd on
macOS).

Here are the most useful ones (IMHO):

|----------------------------+----------------+----------------|
| Description                | Linux/Windows  | macOS          |
|----------------------------+----------------+----------------|
| Open a New Tab             | Ctrl+T         | Cmd+T          |
| Close the current Tab      | Ctrl+W         | Cmd+W          |
| Open Previously closed Tab | Ctrl+Shift+T   | Cmd+Shift+T    |
| Switch to the Next Tab     | Ctrl+Tab       | Ctrl+Tab       |
| Switch to the previous Tab | Ctrl+Shift+Tab | Ctrl+Shift+Tab |
| Scroll One Page Down       | Space          | Space          |
| Scroll One Page Up         | Shift+Space    | Shift+Space    |
| Reload Page                | Ctrl+R         | Cmd+R          |
| Reload Page & Cache        | Ctrl+Shift+R   | Cmd+Shift+R    |
| Open Inspector             | Ctrl+Shift+I   | Cmd+Option+I   |
| Edit the URL               | Ctrl+L         | Cmd+L          |
| Exit from the URL Bar      | Tab            | Tab            |
|----------------------------+----------------+----------------|

There's also support for the common readline shortcuts in the URL field such as
~Alt+Backspace~, ~Ctrl+A~, ~Ctrl+E~, ~Ctrl+F~, ~Ctrl+B~.
This is by default on macOS but needs a bit of a config on Linux:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cat ~/.gtkrc-2.0.mine
gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"
$ cat ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
[Settings]
[...]
gtk-key-theme-name=Emacs
#+END_SRC

That's about it for what's common and useful.
Please note macOS horrible inconsistency!

** C
*** =#include_next=

=#include_next= can be used to override other headers. If you would want to add
some definitions to =stdlib.h= for example, you could write your own =stdlib.h=,
add your definitions in it, and also add =#include_next <stdlib.h>= at the top
of if.

For example it is used in the =string.h= header of libbsd as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#ifdef LIBBSD_OVERLAY
#include_next <string.h>
#else
#include <string.h>
#endif
#+END_SRC

*** Arrays of constant known size

You can tell the compiler that an array should always have a specific size by
including the ~static~ keyword in the function declaration.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
void test(int array[static 10])
{
	array[0] = 0;
}

int main()
{
	int array[3];
	test(array);
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra array-static.c
array-static.c:9:2: error: array argument is too small; contains 3 elements, callee requires at least 10 [-Werror,-Warray-bounds]
        test(array);
        ^    ~~~~~
array-static.c:1:15: note: callee declares array parameter as static here
void test(int array[static 10])
              ^    ~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

**** Integers
***** Overflow

- unsigned integer always wrap properly (the result is always modulo the maximum possible value)
- signed integer overflow is *UNDEFINED*
- undefined behavior can lead to instructions being optimized away
- gcc and clang have built-in functions that check for the overflow https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-9.1.0/gcc/Integer-Overflow-Builtins.html#Integer-Overflow-Builtins https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html
- c compilers assume x + 1 > x is always true (because if x + 1 overflows, that would be undefined behavior)
- c compilers are able to optimise x * 2 / 2 to just x when x is signed thanks to undefined behavior
- negative integers constants don't exist (the unary minus operator is applied to the positive constant)

*Feature Test Macros* are a way for a programmer to control the standards

For example ~_GNU_SOURCE~ can be defined in order to enable gnu specific functions.
Likewise you can define ~_POSIX_C_SOURCE~ to ~200809L~ in order to enable only
the functions from the 2008 specification.

*** Reserved Names

Along with [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/keyword][C keywords]] there is a bunch of reserved names. You can find them
in the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Reserved-Names.html][libc documentation]]. It ranges from libc function names like ~exit~ to
reserved names for future usage by the C or POSIX standards such as names that
begin with ~str~ or ~mem~ for the potential future string and memory functions.

*** Sanitizers
**** ASAN Call Stack

If ASAN doesn't print the call stack with the debug info (supposing they were
compiled with), like so:

As explained [[https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerCallStack][here]]
you need to have llvm-symbolizer in your PATH.

For me it meant installing the =llvm= package on Arch Linux:

*** Standard Library

The Standard Library is automatically linked by a C compiler. That's why you
don't need to link (=-l...=) anything when calling printf() for example.
You can stop that with the =-nostdlib= flag with gcc.

*** Storage-class Specifiers
:PROPERTIES:
:SOURCE: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf
:END:

There are four storage-class specifiers:
- auto
- extern
- static
- register

The storage-class specifiers (except *register*) determine the *linkage* and
*storage duration* of the objects declared with.

The storage-class specifier *register* only suggets that access to the object
should be as fast as possible.

**** Linkage

The Linkage of identifiers defines how they can refer to the same
object/function in different scopes.

*** Type Qualifiers
**** ~const~

In C the ~const~ keyword can be applied in different ways.
In a nutshell, ~const~-qualified objects and struct or union types objects that
have at least one ~const~-qualified member are not modifiable.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
const int a;
int const b;

a = 1;
b = 1;
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror const.c
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
const.c:16:4: error: cannot assign to variable 'a' with const-qualified type 'const int'
        a = 1;
        ~ ^
const.c:13:12: note: variable 'a' declared const here
        const int a;
        ~~~~~~~~~~^
const.c:17:4: error: cannot assign to variable 'b' with const-qualified type 'const int'
        b = 1;
        ~ ^
const.c:14:12: note: variable 'b' declared const here
        int const b;
#+END_SRC

Here are some examples with pointers:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
int * const ptr1;
ptr1 = NULL;

int const * ptr2;
ptr2 = 0;
*ptr2 = 0;
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
const.c:55:7: error: cannot assign to variable 'ptr1' with const-qualified type 'int *const'
        ptr1 = NULL;
        ~~~~ ^
const.c:54:14: note: variable 'ptr1' declared const here
        int * const ptr1;
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~
const.c:59:8: error: read-only variable is not assignable
        *ptr2 = 0;
        ~~~~~ ^
#+END_SRC

Struct or union member acquire the same qualification as the type they are part of:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
struct s {
    int a;
    const int b;
};
const struct s s1;
s1.a = 0;
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
const.c:31:7: error: cannot assign to variable 's3' with const-qualified type 'const struct s'
        s3.a = 0;
        ~~~~ ^
const.c:30:17: note: variable 's3' declared const here
        const struct s s3;

**** ~restrict~

~restrict~ is a pointer type qualifier that tells the compiler that any object
pointed by that pointer, will be accessed/modified only through that same pointer.

This allows the compiler to do more optimizations with that knowledge.

/!\ modifying the object pointed by a restrict-qualified pointer through
another pointer is Undefined Behavior!

Here's an optimization example (taken from [[https://devdocs.io/c/language/restrict][devdocs.io]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC c
int foo(int *a, int *b)
{
    *a = 5;
    *b = 6;
    return *a + *b;
}

int rfoo(int *restrict a, int *restrict b)
{
    *a = 5;
    *b = 6;
    return *a + *b;
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
0000000000000000 <_foo>:
   0:   55                      push   rbp

~volatile~ is a type qualifier that tells the compiler that the variable may be
changed outside of the program, ensuring that the compiler doesn't "optimize
away" the variable and always force re-reading its value when accessing it.

** Compilers
*** Linkers

There is two replacement for the old GNU ld: [[https://lld.llvm.org/][lld]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_(linker)][gold]].
You can find a benchmarking comparing them [[https://lld.llvm.org/#performance][here]].
Make clang use =lld= by adding the =-fuse-ld=lld= flag.

** Debugging
*** Conditional breakpoints with ~lldb~ and ~gdb~

You can set conditional breakpoints in ~lldb~ and ~gdb~:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
int test(int a)
{
	return (a == 42);
}

int main(void)
{
	int tmp;

	for (int i=0 ; i < 1000 ; i++)
		tmp = test(i);
}
#+END_SRC

LLDB (Be careful, the ~b~ command is an alias to ~_regexp-break~ not ~breakpoint~):

** Emacs
*** TODO Overriding ~evil-mode~ keys

# TODO Finish! Find out why bind-key wasn't working but general is

Overriding keys in Emacs can be a pretty tricky task. You first need to
understand that Emacs uses keymaps. The next step is understanding the
precedence of those maps. You can find more information about maps [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/mastering-key-bindings-emacs][in this
masteringemacs entry]], and more about their precedence [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/wiki/Keymaps-guide][in this spacemacs wiki
entry]] (although afaik they're wrong about the ~bind-key~ order), and finally
some more informations about evil mode order [[https://github.com/noctuid/evil-guide#keybindings-and-states][in this awesome guide]].

I used to set some eyebrowse keybindings with the ~bind-key*~ function provided
by the ~use-package~ package. It should let you override any major/minor mode
key by leveraging the keymap ~emulation-mode-map-alist~. However it seems like
it isn't able to override ~evil-mode~ keys.

So I fallbacked to using [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general]] and it is working great so far:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'general)
(general-override-mode)

(defun new-tab ()
  (interactive)
  (eyebrowse-create-window-config)
  (winum-select-window-1)
  (delete-other-windows))

(general-def '(insert normal visual) 'override
  "M-h" 'eyebrowse-prev-window-config
  "M-l" 'eyebrowse-next-window-config
  "M-t" 'new-tab
  "M-d" 'eyebrowse-close-window-config)
#+END_SRC

*** Autosave and Backup files

"#autosave#" and "backup~" files are enabled by default.
You can disable them like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq auto-save-default nil)
(setq make-backup-files nil)
#+END_SRC

An easy way to debug some code is to print messages in the ~*Messages*~ buffer.

Example:

You can [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Built_002din-Table-Editor.html][easily insert tables]] by typing the first columns separated by ~|~ as
such "|column1|column2" and then typing ~C-c RET~.

For example, this:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
|column1|column2
#+END_SRC

would expand to:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
| column1 | column2 |
|---------+---------|
|         |         |

*** Re-entering top level after C stack overflow

If you get this error right after opening a new file, there's a chance it's
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9fs8pp/reentering_top_level_after_c_stack_overflow/][because of the undo-tree file]].

Just delete it to see if that was indeed the problem.

*** ~use-package~

[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][~use-package~]] is a package that makes installing, loading and configuring
packages easier. When using ~use-package~, it can install packages if they
aren't already installed if ~use-package-always-ensure~ is ~true~ or if the
~:ensure~ keyword is set to ~t~. It can execute code before the package is
loaded thanks to the ~:init~ keyword. It can execute code after the package is
loaded with the ~:config~ keyword (and the execution is deferred until after the
package is loaded, even if it is lazy loaded).

This would install the ~evil~ package if not already installed, execute ~(setq
evil-want-C-u-scroll t)~ before the package is loaded, and execute ~(evil-mode
1)~ after it is loaded.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Fonts and Typefaces

Typefaces are collections of glyphs with a particular design. Fonts
are expressions of a typeface with a specific weight (boldness),
slant and size. Font families are fonts with same design type.

The name ~Font~ comes from the French word ~Fonte~ which referred to
the metal castings at type foundries.

The names ~lowercase~ and ~uppercase~ come from metal type cases which
typically stored the small letters in the lower case, and the capital
letters in the upper case.

** Linking
*** Name Mangling

Name mangling is a technique compilers use to differentiate functions in
languages where function overloading is allowed, or where symbols with the
same name can exist in different namespaces.

The compilers need to name mangle before linking in order to let other
programs/libraries link against the right symbol.

C does not allow redifinitions hence it doesn't need name mangling.

Example in C++:
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
void test()
{
}

int main()
{
    test();
}
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ gcc test.cpp && nm a.out
0000000100000f80 T __Z4testv
0000000100000f90 T _main
[...]
#+END_SRC

*** ~LD_PRELOAD~ And ~DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES~

~LD_PRELOAD~ on Linux and ~DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES~ on macOS can be used to "hijack" the
dynamic linking process.

Suppose you have the following program:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    puts("Hello World");
}
#+END_SRC

When compiled it would simply execute as such:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./test
Hello World
#+END_SRC

We can now try to "hijack" the call to puts with a dynamic library like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int puts(const char *s)
{
    char *str = "Hello LD_PRELOAD!\n";
    write(1, str, strlen(str));
}
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ gcc -fPIC -shared libhijack.c -o libhijack.so
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. LD_PRELOAD=libhijack.so ./test
Hello LD_PRELOAD!
#+END_SRC

You can basically do the same with ~DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1 DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=./libhijack.dylib~

You can also call the original function thanks to ~dlsym~:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
#define _GNU_SOURCE

#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int real_puts(const char *s)
{
    // Don't do casts like this kids!
    return (((int(*)(const char *s))dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "puts"))(s));
}

int puts(const char *s)
{
    char *str = "Hello LD_PRELOAD!\n";
    write(1, str, strlen(str));
    return (real_puts(s));
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ gcc -fPIC -shared -ldl libhijack.c -o libhijack.so
❯ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. LD_PRELOAD=libhijack.so ./test
Hello LD_PRELOAD!
Hello World
#+END_SRC

** Linux
*** Boot Process

The file system supported by the Extensible Firmware Interface is based on the
FAT file system. EFI defines a specific version of FAT that is explicitly
documented and testable. Conformance to the EFI specification and its associate
reference documents is the only definition of FAT that needs to be implemented
to support EFI. To differentiate the EFI file system from pure FAT, a new
partition file system type has been defined.
EFI encompasses the use of FAT32 for a system partition, and FAT12 or FAT16 for
removable media. The FAT32 system partition is identified by an OSType value
other than that used to identify previous versions of FAT. This unique partition
type distinguishes an EFI defined file system from a normal FAT file system. The
file system supported by EFI includes support for long file names.

- UEFI finds and opens EFI System Partition
- ESP should be formated with a fat fs. and have the following guid
C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B
- Runs ? efi binary
- Bootloader needs appropriate drivers to open partition that contains kernel
and initramfs if they aren't on the ESP
- Initramfs contains drivers to open the rest of the partitions
- (Arch) initramfs is the one that decrypts partitions (zfs or luks)
(mkinitcpio hooks). it calls =zfs load-key=.
- kernel modules (/usr/lib/modules) which contains devices firmware
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mkinitcpio#Image_creation_and_activation
fallback == all modules
- When the option CONFIG_EFI_STUB is enabled, the kernel will masquerade as a
PE binary and can be directly executed by the UEFI firmware
- Boots configurations are stored in the NVRAM, but the firmware also searches
for standardized file paths; for example, the file path to the OS loader on an
x86-64 system is /efi/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI,[28] and efi\boot\bootaa64.efi on ARM64
architecture.
- If you don't use the std paths, the firmware won't automatically suggest your
efi bootloader and you will probably have to manually configure it from the
firmware or with efibootmgr?
- (binary blobs) are added to the initramfs by mkinitcpio

refind:
TODO Test it can find the root automatically if it has the following
standardized guid 4F68BCE3-E8CD-4DB1-96E7-FBCAF984B709 (x86-64)
(https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/DiscoverablePartitionsSpec/)

gpt/fs:
- https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Persistent_block_device_naming
- GPT partitions have uuid, but filesystems can have one too!
- GPT partitions have labels, but filesystems can have one too!
- GPT partitions have both a guid and a uuid
- GPT partitions have both a unique guid and a type guid (same as above??)
- A GPT disk has a unique uuid
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table#Partition_type_GUIDs
- https://askubuntu.com/questions/703443/gdisk-hex-codes
(gdisk uses non-official short ids based on MBR ones to designate full gpt guids)
- by-id creates a unique name depending on the hardware serial number, by-path
depending on the shortest physical path (according to sysfs).
- by-id could be used when we want to clone the disk, but not immediately use
it?

boot process:
- The bootloader will load the kernel and initial root file system image into
memory and then start the kernel, passing in the memory address of the image. At
the end of its boot sequence, the kernel tries to determine the format of the
image from its first few blocks of data, which can lead either to the initrd or
initramfs scheme.
- In the initrd scheme, the image may be a file system image (optionally
compressed), which is made available in a special block device (/dev/ram) that
is then mounted as the initial root file system.[3] The driver for that file
system must be compiled statically into the kernel. Many distributions
originally used compressed ext2 file system images, while the others (including
Debian 3.1) used cramfs in order to boot on memory-limited systems, since the
cramfs image can be mounted in-place without requiring extra space for
decompression. Once the initial root file system is up, the kernel executes
/linuxrc as its first process;[4] when it exits, the kernel assumes that the
real root file system has been mounted and executes /sbin/init to begin the
normal user-space boot process.[3]
- In the initramfs scheme (available since the Linux kernel 2.6.13), the image may
be a cpio archive (optionally compressed). The archive is unpacked by the kernel
into a special instance of a tmpfs that becomes the initial root file system.
This scheme has the advantage of not requiring an intermediate file system or
block drivers to be compiled into the kernel.[5] Some systems use the dracut
package to create an initramfs image.[6] In the initramfs scheme, the kernel
executes /init as its first process that is not expected to exit.[5]. For some
applications, initramfs can use the casper utility to create a writable
environment using unionfs to overlay a persistence layer over a read-only root
filesystem image. For example, overlay data can be stored on a USB flash drive,
while a compressed SquashFS read-only image stored on a live CD acts as a root
filesystem.[7][8]
- the root file system can be indicated to the kernel with the root="" argument
  the value can be one of:
  - LABEL={Filesystem Label}
  - UUID={Filesystem UUID}
  - /dev/disk/by-...
  - PARTLABEL={GPT Partition Label}
  - PARTUUID={GPT Partition UUID}

fat:
- fat can have 12,16 or 32 bits long pointers in its table. vfat designates a
fat filesystem with support for long file names (vs 8.3). mkfs.vfat will
intelligently select between 12/16 and 32bit based on the partition size
- fat has a max file size of 4GiB and max volume size of 2 or 16TB (4k sectors)
- FAT does not support symlinks

exfat:
- exfat is the default fs of sdxc cards above 32 GiB
- ExFAT does not support symlinks
- Operating systems have supported EXFAT for many years, since:
    Windows: XP
    MacOS: 10.6.3
    Linux: CentOS 5, Ubuntu 10.04, etc.
    Android: 4

mdadm:
ESP Raid 1:

Use mdadm 1.0 so that the raid infos are at the end of the of the partition, and
the ESP partition still looks like one to the BIOS. (Instead of being
encapsulated inside a mdadm block (1.1 and 1.2))
This should not conflict with the FAT fs, and i've checked this myself (no data
at the end of the partition) ???????? Unless the fs is full??
If the firmware modifies the ESP it will lead to mdadm/fat corruption.
Another solution would be to keep both ESP in sync fully manually, resolving
conflicts automatically (either by copying from a trusted external source or by
merging and keeping everything)
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/QTRRMZU6PORBTGSATUFUIEUKY7QYA3PV/
According to my single unscientific test, even completely filling the vfat
partition doesn't overwrite the mdadm metadata.

BIOS /boot raid 1:


usb/sdcard idea:
- gpt?
- 1 vfat32 part for ESP ? How to hide?
  - one refind entry for every zfs snapshot?
- 1 vfat32 part for old printers?
- 1 exfat part for backups?
- 1 zfs part for pc copies ?

Once you've made a raid1 on p1, you won't be able to mount p1 as vfat. I guess
it's the kernel that overrides it. You need to mount /dev/md0. But I guess the
firmware won't have such a problem.

*** Tainted Kernel

The kernel is said to be tainted when it fits certain conditions such as loading
a proprietary module. Tainting the kernel lets the kernel developer refuse to
treat some bug reports because the debugging conditions would not be the proper,
usual ones.

** Make
*** ~LDLIBS~ and ~LDFLAGS~

~LDLIBS~ and ~LDFLAGS~ are two distinct [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html#Implicit-Variables][implicit variables]] in Gnu Make and you
should use them properly if you are making use of the [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/make/manual/html_node/Catalogue-of-Rules.html#Catalogue-of-Rules][implicit rules]].

In a nutshell the implicit rule for linking object files is ~$(CC) $(LDFLAGS)
n.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)~ and you will run into compilation problems if you
put your library flags (~-llib~) in ~LDFLAGS~ because it appears before the
object, and we all know that the [[https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2013/07/09/library-order-in-static-linking][order of library flags matters]]!

*** ~pkg-config~

~pkg-config~ is a utility in the C ecosystem that facilitates the work of
generating the proper dependencies flags.

For example, you can put the following in your Makefile when you need to use a
bsd specific function (eg. strlcpy).
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
ifeq ($(UNAME), Linux)
	CFLAGS += `pkg-config --cflags libbsd-overlay`
	LDLIBS += `pkg-config --libs libbsd-overlay`
endif
#+END_SRC

The commands will produce the following flags:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ pkg-config --cflags libbsd-overlay
-isystem /usr/include/bsd -DLIBBSD_OVERLAY
$ pkg-config --libs libbsd-overlay
-lbsd
#+END_SRC

If a library depends on another one, it will also include it in the generated
flags:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ pkg-config --libs libpng
-lpng16 -lz
#+END_SRC

*** Daemon

You can turn a script into a daemon with only a few instructions:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import daemon
import time

with daemon.DaemonContext():
    while True:
        my_function()
        time.sleep(300)
#+END_SRC

*** Divisions

In python 2 and 3 the divisions can be a bit confusing. In python 2 the type of
the result depends on the type of the operators. It would be an integer if both
operands were integers and a float otherwise. Hence the operator ~/~ did a
C-style division (floor division) when dividing integers, eg ~2/3~ would be ~1~.

With [[https://docs.python.org/release/2.2.3/whatsnew/node7.html][PEP 238]] python 3 ~/~ will always do a "true division", meaning that ~2/3~
or ~2/3.0~ will always return the expected result ~1.5~, and always as a float
regardless of the type of the operands.

This PEP also introduced the ~//~ operator for python 2/3 which will always do a
floor division.

Examples in python 2:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> 3/2
1
>>> 3/2.0
1.5
>>> 3//2
1
>>> 3//2.0
1.0
#+END_SRC

Examples in python 3:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> 3/2
1.5
>>> 3/2.0
1.5
>>> 3//2
1
>>> 3//2.0
1.0

**** shebang ~#!~

We all know that on UNIX systems the shebang is used by the kernel to choose which interpreter to
use for reading and executing the file. You can see an example of this in [[https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/binfmt_script.c#L17][fs/binfmt_script.c]].

However another little known fact is that most shells will try and execute a
file if it couldn't be executed by the kernel and if it looks like a text file.

*** Terminal
**** Capabilities

Terminal capabilities describe the features a particular terminal
supports, such as colors, italics, and others.  They are determined by
their associated terminfo databases on Linux and termcap databases on
BSD systems.

On Linux you can use the ~infocmp~ command to show the different
capabilities a terminal supports. By default it will print the
capabilites about the current ~$TERM~.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ infocmp
#       Reconstructed via infocmp from file: /home/me/.terminfo/t/tmux-24bit
tmux-24bit|tmux with 24-bit direct color mode,
        am, hs, km, mir, msgr, xenl,
        colors#0x100, cols#80, it#8, lines#24, pairs#0x10000,
[...]
#+END_SRC

Be mindful that some capabilities won't appear for reasons unknown to
me (eg. ~setb24~ and ~setf24~ in the following example).

You can also do diffs with ~infocmp -d~.

You can easily extend the capabilities of a terminal by creating your
own .terminfo that sources the one you want to extend.

Here's an example of my own extension of ~tmux-256color~ that enables 24bit colors in tmux and emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cat tmux-24bit.terminfo
tmux-24bit|tmux with 24-bit direct color mode,
   use=tmux-256color,
# True colors for emacs
# https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/efaq.html#Colors-on-a-TTY
   setb24=\E[48;2;%p1%{65536}%/%d;%p1%{256}%/%{255}%&%d;%p1%{255}%&%dm,
   setf24=\E[38;2;%p1%{65536}%/%d;%p1%{256}%/%{255}%&%d;%p1%{255}%&%dm,
# True colors for Tmux
# https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728#gistcomment-2110619
# https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/018f1b8a803f15910781dc9894fbd168cfa50943/tty-term.c#L570
# Needed for nested tmux too!
   Tc,
   RGB,
#+END_SRC

You then compile that terminfo like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ tic -x -o ~/.terminfo tmux-24bit.terminfo
#+END_SRC

**** Keys Weirdness

[[https://catern.com/posts/terminal_quirks.html][This awesome article]] talks about the weirdness of terminals and explains why some
keys are equivalent to others.

In a nutshell, in terminals the Ctrl and Shift don't send keycodes on their own,
but they modify the keycodes sent by other characters.

Shift clears the 6th bit, so typing ~i~ would send ~0o151~ and ~Shift + i~ would
send ~0o111~ which is the code for the ascii character ~I~.

Ctrl clears the 6th and 7th bit of the ascii character. So ~i~ would send
~0o151~ and ~Ctrl + i~ would send ~0o011~ which is ~TAB~.

So ~Ctrl + i~, ~Ctrl + Shift + i~ and ~TAB~ are all equivalent!

Of course there's some exceptions .... this only happens for alphanumeric
characters. Also ~Ctrl + Shift + ?~ sends ~DEL~.

FIXME why does Emacs detect ~C-j~ rather than ~linefeed~? My guess is
that it cheats and internally predicts that you typed ~linefeed~ by
typing ~C-j~.

** Valgrind
*** vgdb

Valgrind incorporates a gdb server that allows one to debug a program and refine
his search of undefined behavior or memory leaks.

In order to use this you should run valgrind on your program with the following
arguments: ~--vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0~

Example:

==58713== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running

#+END_SRC

You can now continue the program, add breakpoints, step and stuff, just like
in good ol' gdb.

What valgrind add, is a command: ~monitor~. With this command you can query
valgrind about a lot of things.

For example you can use ~monitor leak_check reachable any~ to show any reachable
or lost allocation:
#+BEGIN_SRC
(gdb) monitor leak_check reachable any
==61216== 1 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 1 of 43
[...]
==61216==    by 0x1000012D9: main (main.c:122)
==61216==
==61216== 12 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 2 of 43
[...]
==61216==    by 0x1000012D9: main (main.c:122)
==61216==
==61216== LEAK SUMMARY:
==61216==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==61216==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==61216==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==61216==    still reachable: 13 bytes in 2 blocks
==61216==         suppressed: 18,193 bytes in 158 blocks
#+END_SRC

You can also show information about the allocations with ~monitor block_list
<num>~ (the number being one of the "loss record <num> of ..."):
#+BEGIN_SRC
(gdb) monitor block_list 1
==61216== 1 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 1 of 43
[...]
==61216==    by 0x1000012D9: main (main.c:122)
==61216== 0x100B65CD0[1]
#+END_SRC

~0x100B65CD0~ is the address of the block that was allocated. Since it is still
reachable you can ask valgrind to tell us who still points to this address with
~monitor who_points_at <address>~:
#+BEGIN_SRC
(gdb) monitor who_points_at 0x100B65CD0
==61216== Searching for pointers to 0x100b65cd0
==61216== *0x1000032a8 points at 0x100b65cd0
 Address 0x1000032a8 is in the Data segment of ./test
#+END_SRC

And with gdb you can possible find the variable behind this address with ~info
symbol <address>~:
#+BEGIN_SRC
(gdb) info symbol 0x1000032a8
my_function.my_static + 24 in section .bss of test
#+END_SRC

** Vulnerabilities
*** https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14287

In Sudo before 1.8.28, an attacker with access to a Runas ALL sudoer account can
bypass certain policy blacklists and session PAM modules, and can cause
incorrect logging, by invoking sudo with a crafted user ID. For example, this
allows bypass of !root configuration, and USER= logging, for a "sudo -u
\#$((0xffffffff))" command.

**** The Miracle Morning
***** Introduction

The author tells his story, about his great life and then about a
terrific accident and how he didn't let this affect him and was even
more successful after that. A second event in his life -- us economic
depression, debt, depression -- was overcome with the /Miracle Morning/.

***** It's Time To Wake Up To Your FULL Potential

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As bestselling author, Seth Godin has so eloquently put it, "Is there
a difference between average and mediocre? Not so much."
#+END_QUOTE

- Miracle Morning = Life changing
- More and better of everything
- Early rise?

  # Too much blabla, still don't know what it is.

***** The Miracle Morning: Born Out of Desperation

The /Miracle Morning/ is about:

- Waking up early
- Personal development
- Bootstrapping an energized day

The author recollects how waking up one morning at 5am re-motivated him.
He even woke up at 4am then and felt even better.

***** The 95% Reality Check

Mediocrity

Stats: 95% of the Americans are mediocre (not financially secure or dead
...).

# Money once again ...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Being average means to settle for less than you truly want and are
capable of, and to struggle for your entire life.
#+END_QUOTE

- Acknowledge our mediocre status

- Identify the causes of mediocrity:

  - Rear-view Mirror Syndrome (RMS): who we were is who we are

  - Life of purpose

  - Isolating incidents: > T. Harv Eker said in his best-selling book
    Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, "How you do > anything is how you
    do everything."

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Every time you choose to do the easy thing, instead of the right
    thing, you are shaping your identity, becoming the type of person
    who does what's easy, rather than what's right.
    #+END_QUOTE

  - Lack of accountability (someone holds you accountable of your
    actions, hence success)

  - Mediocre circle of influence

  - Lack of personal development:

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    In my opinion, none was greater than the idea that our levels of success
    will rarely exceed our level of personal development, because success is
    something we attract by who we become.
    #+END_QUOTE

  - Lack of urgency (life will work itself out)

- Draw your line in the sand: Decide /now/ what you are going to start
  doing differently from now on!

***** Why Did YOU Wake Up This Morning?

How much sleep do we really need? Author seems to say studies and
experts contradict themselves and aren't [missing end of sentence].

/Miracle Morning/ is about deciding how energized you are going to wake
up no matter how much you slept.

study: best practice: Do Deep Study Sessions

***** Step 1 Manage Your Time in Five Minutes a Day

Suggested Method:

Things Needed:
- A Calendar
- A List you can access and edit during the day

Things to Do:
- Each morning:
  - Take the things to remember on yesterday's list and schedule them
    accordingly in the calendar. Either put a to-do on a appropriate date or put
    a reminder some days before.
  - Move the yesterday's to-dos that you didn't complete to new days
    in the calendar.
  - Put two columns on your list of the day:
    - Today's Schedule
    - Things to Remember
  - Examine each items of the current day in the calendar and try to fit them
    realistically in Today's Schedule
  - Try to realistically label each item with a specific time period. Be
    pessimistic about them.
  - Schedule large breaks (eg. not twenty minutes).
  - If possible, end the day at an appropriate hour, you will need to unwind and
    relax before sleep.
  - Reschedule the remaining items in the calendar to later dates.
  - Change the Schedule during the day if anything unexpected comes up, but try
    not to use this as an excuse to procrastinate.
  - Remember: If you complete most items, five days a week, YOU ARE PRODUCTIVE!
- During the day:
  - Write down any new to-dos or scheduled things or change in schedule in the
    Things to Remember column. This is important because it helps you get all
    those new to-dos and deadlines out of your head, as quickly as possible,
    until you properly schedule them with a fresh mind in the morning.

This method is particulary fit for periods of neglect, because you'll both feel
decreased productivity and you'll only need to dump what's in your head in the
calendar to get started.

***** Step 2 Declare War on Procrastination

Anti procrastination helpers:
- Work progress journal:
  - In the morning write in a notebook the most important tasks of the day.
  - In the evening write either "All completed" or why the tasks were not done.
- Good eating and drinking habits:
  - Drink plenty of water
  - Don't drink too much coffee
  - Eat for energy not satisfaction
  - Don't skip meals and have a large breakfast
- Make an event out of the worsts tasks
  - Reward yourself before and after
  - Work on the task in another place if that helps
- Make a habit/routine out of studying:
  - Eg. every morning for one hour
  - Sooner is better because you have more motivation and less chance of being
    hijacked for other "activities"
  - Use these moments to study the same things
- Plan ahead hard days:
  - Lockdown and study hard if the current workload requires it
  - Plan relaxing days before and after these hard days

need distributed computing to be solved, with only a single or a few desktop machines.

His take on the subject of distributed computing and solving large problems is that you can go
higher, by giving more resources to a machine, go wider, by using distributed computing, or go
deeper, by using better algorithms and data structures. He solved some problems by going deeper and
then higher when he needed to scale more.

How to close the TOCTOU (or Place Of Check to Place Of Use) gap for hardware?

For software a signed hash lets the user check that the software shipped is the
same than the one he got.
However there is no hash function for hardware!

Implants:
- Add IC in package:
  - Add another chip in a package (connected with wirebonds)
  - Trough-Silicon Via
- IC Modification:
  - RTL Tampering
  - Hard IP Tampering
  - Mask Tampering

Are trusted factories a solution? Couriers/Customs/Distributors/... can still
insert implants!

What about better microscopes? The most useful ones are huge and very expensive.
Also you're only checking one chip!

Open source hardware could still help fix SPECTRE-like bugs through
peer-reviews.

Tradeoff between ease of verification and features/usability.

Possible solution: [[https://betrusted.io/][Betrusted]].

Why a device and not a chip? Because all the parts need to be trusty, including
the screen and keyboards for example.

Visually inspectable keyboard and screen!

The Silicon Problem: Thorough analysis requires removing layers of metal. This
is destructive.

A compromise is to use FPGAs. They are user configurable. Not all toolchains are
open source yet.

Pseudo-random mapping of design to the device. This hinders mask attacks. A true
backdoor would require a lot more silicon.

I/O MITM Mitigations:
- Design level: Bus encryption
- Implementation level: Permute data pin mappings on every device
- Hardware level: Careful X-ray inspection of devices

Closed Silicon Mitigation: [[https://symbiflow.github.io/prjxray-db/][prjxray-db]]. This is an open project that aims at
checking the consistency of the FPGA bitstream.

Ability to seal keys in the FPGA: Encrypted keys into encrypted bitstream in
ROM. AES-only boot bit blown.

Writing your own textbook might be the best way to really understand the one
you're reading.
Apart from the benefits of reformulation, you will write a textbook that fits
your ideas and mind.

Also reading line by line after the chapter introduction lets you see a proof
proposition and try to prove it yourself. That way you will be more prepared
when you get to the exercices. This idea is very close to my "invent/try
yourself before reading the answer".

Other people have answered this question by saying that you need to "make the
idea your own, making it fit in with your own perspective and experiences".
Writing your own textbook might be a good way to formalize this process.

*** Learning How to Learn
**** Week 1
***** Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

Metaphors are powerful tools for learning.

There is two fundamental modes of thinking:

- Focused (the most familiar)
- Diffuse (more relaxed mode of thinking)

Diffuse is best for learning new things.

Pin-Ball Machine analogy:

- Focused mode: The ball bounces directly to packed familiar thoughts
- Diffuse mode: The ball bounces randomly to looser/more spaced thoughts

You can't be in both mode at the same time.

***** Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes (Or, a Little Dali will do You)

Dali used to relax and let his mind go free, with keys in his hand, and
as he would fall asleep, the keys would fall and wake him up just in
time to recollect all his thoughts from his diffuse thinking before
using them in focused mode.

According to the legend, Edison would do the same (but with ball
bearings).

When learning something new, your mind needs to go back and forth
between both modes.

***** What is Learning?

The brain is the most complex object in the universe. There are a
million billion synapses in the brain. Synapses are less than a micron
in diameter. Learning seems to be correlated to the formation of new
synapses on dendrites. We will learn how to take advantage of our
subconscious mind and how sleep affects our learning.

***** A Procrastination Preview

Looking at something you would rather not do seems to activate a region
of your brain associated with pain (Insular Cortex). It will try to
avert your attention from it. Researchers have found that not long after
working on this unpleasant task this neural discomfort disappears.

The Pomodoro technique consists in setting a timer for 25 minutes, and
focusing for that duration with no interruptions. After that you can
give yourself a small reward (pleasant activity).

***** Practice Make Permanent

Science is harder because of abstraction. Practice is needed to improve
our understanding of abstract ideas. The neurons thought pattern becomes
real through practice. Changing our focus (or relaxing) allows our brain
to use his diffuse mode to work in the background and improve our
knowledge base.

***** Introduction to Memory

There is two types of memory:

- Long term memory
- Working memory

The working memory (Prefrontal cortex) holds only ~4 chunks of
information. Grouping chunks will make it seem larger. Repetition is
needed in order to keep this memory active.

Long term memory is distributed over a large areas of the brain.
Revisiting long term memories can help to ensure the information will be
there later on. It stores fundamental concepts. When learning something
you need to move the information from short to long term memory,
preferably with spaced repetition.

***** The importance of Sleep in Learning

Just by being awake, our brain produces toxic waste. When sleeping, your
brain cells shrink, and it allows the brain to flush this toxic waste.

When sleeping the brains also tidies ideas, erases less important parts,
and strengthen the things you are trying to learn. It also replays some
neural patterns related to things you are trying to learn. It's as if
deactivating the focused part of your brain helps the rest to find the
neural solution of what you are trying to learn.

***** Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

What do you do to learn something new:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Learning by doing. Not by reading a book, but just by going to the thick of
it (eg. doing experiments).
#+END_QUOTE

How do you keep your attention:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Active engagement.
#+END_QUOTE

How do you use diffuse mode:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Jogging helps with that. He takes notes to remember those ideas.
#+END_QUOTE

Do you multitask?:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Yes, essential. Doing two things at the same time is close to impossible.
Multitasking is about context switching. Some are better at that than others.
#+END_QUOTE

How do you apply your own knowledge of neuroscience to your own
learning:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You have all the same neurons than at birth. Except in the hippocampus,
where neurons can be created. Enriched environment creates much stronger
bounds in the hippocampus than in closed environments. Exercise also
increases the number of new neurons that are being born.
#+END_QUOTE

Any special techniques to learn or focus:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Enriched environments help.
#+END_QUOTE

Test taking?:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Do not hung up on questions where you stuck. The answer may come up later.
#+END_QUOTE

How do you keep creativity?:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Environment, colleagues, youth etc...
#+END_QUOTE

How to learn effectively?:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Being passionate, and persistent helps
#+END_QUOTE

**** Week 2
***** Introduction to Chunking

Chunks are compact packages of information that our mind can easily
access. Illusions of competence in learning is when you are using
ineffective methods of learning. Interleaving studies can be very
valuable.

***** What is a Chunk?

A chunk is a compact package of information. It helps memorizing new
concepts as it has context. Without context memorizing information would
be much harder. When focusing on something you also make connections
from the "four working chunks" to other parts of your brain. Stress
hinders that process. Chunks are pieces of information bound together
through meaning or use. A chunk is a network of neurons that are used to
fire together. Expertise comes by creating little by little more chunks.

***** How to Form a Chunk - Part 1

You first need to grasp bits and pieces. Then you gradually merge them
with larger chunks and so on. The best chunks are the one you don't even
have to think about to use. One easy mistake might be to focus too
much on how something works, and not on the connection between steps. In
science, it helps to start out with a work through example.

***** How to Form a Chunk - Part 2

Chunking can be different in different domains. You need to focus
exclusively. You also need to understand the basic concepts in question.
Even though you can understand a new concept at some point, you need to
review it to ensure you remember it. Testing yourself alone can greatly
help. Gaining context to see when to or not to use a chunk is very
important. Practice should help with this. Learning can be done "Bottom
up" which chunking, or "Top down" with a big picture process. Both are
vital. Glancing through the material first, can help you get a big
picture, and later on have the necessary context to use the chunks
properly.

***** Illusions of Competence

Recall is much more productive than just re-reading the material. You
just need to look away from the material and try to recall what you just
learned. It helps learning far more and at a much deeper level.

Concept mapping may not be that beneficial because trying to build
connections between chunks before understanding the basic chunks doesn't
work.

The only time re-reading helps in learning, is when you re-read the
material later on, just as an exercise of spaced repetition.

Glancing at a solution is a big illusion of competence in learning. You
need to have the competence in your memory.

Highlighting and underlining must be done carefully. Try to highlight
only main ideas when you think you have found them.

Having the book or the notes near you can give you an illusion of
competence, because it can be easier to look at the material than
recall.

Testing yourself is the best way to defeat this illusion of competence.
Mistakes are valuable when you self-test because they will help you make
repairs in your thinking flaws.

Recalling when you are outside can help strengthening your learning
because the memories of the learning material wouldn't be as deeply
connected to your surrounding as before.

***** What Motivates You?

Being interested in the material helps learning.

Acetylcholine neurons produce acetylcholine which is important for
focused learning.

Our motivation is controlled by dopamine. It is released when we receive
an unexpected reward. It is in the business of future rewards, and not
just the immediate reward. (Drugs artificially increase dopamine
activity.) Loss of dopamine leads to Anhedonia, the loss of dopamine.
Promising yourself to a treat after a study section taps into your
dopamine system.

Serotonin strongly affects your social life. It is also linked to risk
taking behavior.

Research show that emotions are intertwined with perception and attention
and interact with learning and memory.

You want to keep you amygdala happy to be an effective learner.

***** The Value of a Library of Chunks

Combining chunks is the root of lots of innovation. Chunking isn't all
to learning, but it is very important.

Transfer is when you find links between chunks between different
domains.

As you learn more about a subject, you will be able to create larger
chunks. Having a good library of chunks helps solve new problems.

Building chunks fills a part of the big picture.

Two ways of solving problems:

- Sequential: Small consecutive steps
- Holistic (global): Diffuse mode linking of focused thoughts

Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck favors the one who tries. After learning
the first concept, the second should be easier, and so on.

***** Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

Overlearning is continuing to study something you already master. It can
help for automaticity.

Research has show it can be a waste of valuable time. Focusing again and
again in the same learning session doesn't strengthen for the long term
memory.

Focusing on the more difficult material is called "Deliberate Practice".

"Einstellung" is when an initial thought with an idea you already have
in mind may hide a better solution. It means "mindset".

Mastering a new subject means not only creating basic chunks but also
when to use them. Interleaving, which consists in exercising with
problems that require different methods, helps for this.

**** Week 3
***** Tackling Procastination

Not all procrastination is bad. Learning is a bit by bit process. You
want to avoid "cramming" which doesn't build solid neural structures.
Willpower uses a lot of neural resources. The best is not having to use
it to fight procrastination. Procrastination can almost be thought as an
addiction.

***** Zombies Everywhere

Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit. Habit is an
energy saver. You don't have to think in a focused manner.

Habits have four parts:

- The cue: The trigger that launches you in zombie mode.
- The routine: The zombie mode.
- The reward: Habits develop and continue because it rewards us.
  Immediate little feeling pleasure. Finding ways to reward good habits
  is important.
- The belief: You believe in your habit.

***** Process vs Product

Learning can be painful at first. How we handle this is important.

To avoid procrastination, focus on the /Process/ not the /Product/. The
/Product/ is what creates the negative thoughts. This helps yourself to
back away from judging yourself.

***** Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You

The trick to overcoming habits is to change the reaction to the cue.
This is the only place where you need to apply willpower.

Four parts of habits:

1. The cue: Location - Time - How you feel - Reactions
2. The routine: The key to rewiring is to have a plan.
3. The reward: Give yourself a reward. Only when your brain expects a
   reward will it overcome previous cravings.
4. The belief: You need to believe that your new habit is worth it, that
   you can make it.

***** Juggling Life and Learning

- Weekly list of key tasks
- Daily "to do" list

Do the "to do" list before going to sleep because it helps the
subconscious grapple with the future tasks. Tasks lists free working
memory in favor of problem solving. Mixing other tasks makes everything
more enjoyable and keeps you from prolonged and unhealthy bouts of
sitting. Note what does work, and what doesn't. You put what you think
can fit in a day. Planning your quitting time is as important as
planning your working time.

Eat the frog first.

***** Diving Deeper into Memory

We have outstanding visual and spatial memory.

For something to move from working to long-term memory, you need two
things:

- The idea should be memorable
- The idea must be repeated

Flashcards are useful to remember things through recall.

***** What is Long Term Memory?

The hippocampus is essential in storing new information in long term
memory.

Re-consolidation:

- Memory is in Active State (AS) in Short Term Memory
- It moves to Long Term Memory through /Consolidation/
- It can be brought back to STM through /Reactivation/
- And so on

Old memories can change.

The brain contain cells other than the neurons called glial cells. The
most common of which are /astrocytes/. It may have an important role in
learning.

They:

- provide nutrients to neurons
- maintain extra cellular ion balance
- are involved with repair following injury

***** Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

Creating meaningful groups helps remembering things.

Associating numbers with memorable events or with familiar numerical
system. Memorable sentences (first letter of each word).

Memory Palace (Memory Loci), good for lists:

Place the objects to remember in a place you remember well.

The more you use those tools, the more creative you become.

**** Week 4
***** How to Become a Better Learner

- Exercise! New neurons are born everyday in the Hippocampus. New
  neurons will die if you don't use them. New experiences help rescue
  them. Exercise also helps new neurons survive.

- There are certain critical periods in the development of your brain.
  The critical period for first language acquisition extends up to
  puberty. Binocular depth perception matures during the first two years
  of life. Practice can repair as well as train the brain, but this
  takes much longer past the critical period. The prefrontal cortex is
  the last part of the cortex to mature.

***** Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

Learning doesn't progress logically. Some kind of knowledge collapse
seems to occur when your mind is restructuring its understanding to
build a more solid foundation.

***** Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy

Metaphor or analogies are great tools to remember things. The more
visual the better. It's helpful to pretend that you are the concept
you're trying to understand. Metaphors and analogies are useful for
getting people out of /Einstellung/ that is being blocked by thinking
about a problem in the wrong way.

***** No Need for Genius Envy (The Imposter Syndrome)

People learn by trying to make sense by the information they perceive.
They rarely learn anything complex simply by having someone else tell it
to them.

Even though you may be more intelligent, (eg having 9 things in working
memory) you will have less creativity, because of /Einstellung/. The
idea you are already holding in mind can block you from fresh thoughts.

Deliberate practice, especially on tougher material can lift your more
/Median/ brain in the range of the more gifted ones.

***** Change you Thoughts, Change your Life

/Myelin sheaths/, the fatty insulation that helps signals move more
quickly along a neuron, seems not to finish developing in some people
until their twenties.

When you use neural circuits however, it seems you help build it over
them. Practice appears to strengthen and reinforce connections between
different brain regions.

Anyone can change their own brain.

Approaching material with a goal of learning on your own, can give you a
unique path to /mastery/. Often it's only when you sneak off to other
books or videos that you begin to see what you learn through a single
teacher or book is a partial version of the 3D reality of the subject.

***** The Value of Teamwork

The right hemisphere helps us step back and put our work into big
picture perspective. The right hemisphere is vital in doing reality
checks. The left hemisphere supposedly interprets the world for us.

You should be careful about overly confident perspectives. Step back and
check!

"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the
easiest person to fool" - Richard Feynman

Study groups are helpful tools to keep yourself in check. But be careful
of small-talk.

***** A Test Checklist

- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
- Did you work with classmates on homework problems or at least check
  your solution with others?
- Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before
  working with classmates?
- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions
  contributing ideas and asking questions?
- Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you
  were having trouble with something?
- Did you understand all your homework problem solutions when they were
  handed in?
- Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions
  that weren't clear to you?
- If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the
  test and convince yourself you could do everything on it?
- Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without
  spending time on the Algebra in calculations?
- Did you go over the study guide and problems with class mates and quiz
  one another?
- If there was a review session before the test, did you attend and ask
  questions about anything you weren't sure about?
- Did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test? If your answer
  is no, your answers to all the preceding questions may not matter.

***** The /Hard Start - Jump to Easy/ Technique

For many people it's counter productive to start on easy problems and
end with hard problems. You may need to access diffuse mode, but it
would be hard to do if your last problem is the hardest one.

Take a quick look to the test. Then start with the hardest one. This
helps loading the hardest problem in mind. Then switching away to easy
problem will help diffuse mode do its magic. It's also a valuable
technique to avoid Einstellung because you see the problems from
different perspectives.

The hardest part is to pull yourself off a problem once you find
yourself stuck a minute or two.

***** Final Helpful Hints for Tests

When stressed one good workaround is to change your mindset about it.
"I'm not stressed, I'm excited! I'm determined to do my best!"

Breathe with your stomach in order to relax.

Cover up the answers to multiple choices questions, and try to recall.

Face your fears. Have a plan B for your career choice if it depends on
this test.

Step back during the test to ask yourself if your answer makes sense in
a big picture manner.

Check your answers back to front to give your brain a fresh perspective.

*** DONE You can grow new brain cells. Here's how | Sandrine Thuret
:PROPERTIES:
:Source: https://youtu.be/B_tjKYvEziI
:END:

Adults can generate new neurons cells. It is called neurogenesis and it
happens in the Hippocampus. We estimate that 700 new neurons are produced each
day.

If blocked, some kinds of new memories can't be formed as well.

Animals with depression have been linked with lower neurogenesis. Also giving
antidepressants increased neurogenesis and decreased depression symptoms.
Moreover blocking the neurogenesis blocked the efficacy of the antidepressants.

Sport, learning, and sex will increase neurogenesis.
Old age, stress, and sleep deprivation will decrease neurogenesis.

Intermittent fasting, calorie restriction, some antioxydants and nutrients will
increase neurogenesis.
Alcohol, some vitamin defiencies, high sugar and soft diets (soft instead of
crunchy or chewy foods) will decrease neurogenesis.

Resveratol, which is found in red wines has been found to help the survival of
these new neurons. So choose red wine instead of other alcohols if you really
want to drink alcohol.

:PROPERTIES:
:Source: https://www.redgreencode.com/how-long-should-you-spend-on-a-problem/
:END:

Most of the time, the context will dictate how long you can work on a problem.
Eg. at work or in a class exam.

Working for too long on a problem makes you miss opportunities to learn new
things (which may actually help you on the original problem).

Principles:
- Work as long as you’re making progress
- Work after you get stuck
- Take breaks
- Collect data

How to Use Solutions:
- Read the solution gradually
- To understand the solution, you first have to understand the problem
- Calibrate your time-to-look
- Read the solution even if you solve the problem on your own

  Transparency Logs
- Try random combinations of words used in the podcast
- Analyze the video frames by frames, and clearly show differences between two

Words:
Users are not robots. Speak human to them.
Write with your heart and edit with your brain.
Consistency is key.

Declutter-ing-ness:
Show everything can be very appealing but it imposes a very high cognitive load on the user.
"Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
100 clear screens are always better than 1 cluttered one.
Whitespace is good.

Clarity:
Improving clarity should feel like an invisible hand guiding the user.
"Clarity refers to the focus on one particulare message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to
accomplish too much at once..." - Michael Hoffman
Illumination:
Build trust by using colors and patterns consistently.
The Golden Rule: Explain things like you would like them explained to you.
Use colors.

Testing Designs:
Leave room in your schedules/processes for errors.

Being Humble:
Ego kills design.
Ego stops learning.
Become mindful.
Be Honest.
Failure = Opportunity.

Delight Our Users:
Create a personality.
