// Exercise 1.11: Try fetchall with longer argument lists, such as samples from the top million
// websites available at alexa.com. How does the program behave if a web site just doesnâ€™t respond?
// (Section 8.9 describes mechanisms for coping in such cases.)

// An error is printed. Example:
// Get "http://random09809098983.com": dial tcp: lookup random09809098983.com: no such host
// Get "https://expired.badssl.com/": x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid: current time 2020-08-22T12:43:42Z is after 2015-04-12T23:59:59Z
